# Shopify API Workshop - Techyon Series

## Hi

This repo contains all the working files for a workshop I hosted July 25th, at UW.

You can use this, and host it if you want as well.

Contained is the MD for the workshop website, as well as a markdown version of my talk. There's also the MD version for a deckset deck, and a Keynote file.

### Workshop Format

1. Opening intro and talk session with icebreaker
2. General refresher / first dive into API's in the Shopify context
3. Workshop tasks to familiarize participants with using Shopify's API within Postman.
4. An app challenge at the end.
