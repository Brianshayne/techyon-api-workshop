### Title

Getting Started with Shopify's API http://tinyurl.com/techyonrocks

### Audience

From beginnings, through to experts - with a focus on API familiarity before diving in and creating an app or script.

### About the Author

Brian Donohue is a Solutions Engineer at Shopify Plus, in Waterloo Ontario. He's been with Shopify for 3 years, and his role includes concepting out third party integrations with Shopify, making sure they scale and determining fit for new customers on Shopify Plus.

### Prerequisites

This workshop assumes you have a computer, a text editor, [Postman](www.getpostman.com) and a sense of humour.

### Setup

 **Security Disclaimer**

I'm about to list key pairs that are used for authentication with a Shopify store. When you are developing for clients please keep your key secure, or use our oAuth implementation for authentication - don't post your keys publicly like I am. These will be purged after the workshop.

**Seriously, don't**

OK; now that we're settled there - you'd likely have been handed a stickie with a number on it. This number corresponds to the credentials you should use for this workshop.
