# TURN IT UP TO 11: APPly your skills.

## SOLO TASK

### THINGS YOU NEED
- YOUR LAPTOP
- AN INTERNET CONNECTION
- [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) (maybe)
- A dev environment of some sort. You choose. This is a stretch goal.

### GETTING STARTED
- A good understanding of the above
- The ability to either write a shell script or stand up a quick app. [Task 4](task4.md) has a hint for you.

### TASK
1. You’ve learnt the basics, now let’s wrap it together. You’re now a developer for jessesfantasticwidgets.com. Your customer needs to import products into their store. They receive data feeds from their supplier in this format: Download [the csv here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brianshayne/techyon-api-workshop/master/assets/techyon_workshop_import.csv)
2. Please import and create products from this format, using the CSV above - mapping it to Shopify’s format.
3. Please write your Shopify product IDs in the space provided on the import.
4. From here, generate an order using some of the products you’ve just created.
5. Flag the order high risk via the API.

#### STUCK?
Try finding a gem or library to help you parse the CSV
