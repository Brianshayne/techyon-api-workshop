# TASK 5: Let’s sell some things
## SOLO TASK

### THINGS YOU NEED
- YOUR LAPTOP
- AN INTERNET CONNECTION
- POSTMAN (https://www.getpostman.com/)

### GETTING STARTED
- You should already have the Postman collection installed.
- If you’re selling things, what’s the object that the customer *likely* needs to investigate or, hopefully buy… This is what you’re creating.

### TASK
1. OK - time to get serious here. We need something to sell. Let’s get that something up on our Shopify store. Choose the object that you think might fit here, and create one! You should include some basic details, a title, and an image.
2. POST up that new shiny object and show it to a volunteer (within the Shopify store, not your API payload this time) to move on.

#### Stuck? 
Psssst: You’re creating a product. Use the stuck hints from before to try to find the doc. Don’t forget Postman has a template for this.
