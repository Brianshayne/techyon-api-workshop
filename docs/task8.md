# TASK 8: ORDER OOPS!

## SOLO TASK

### THINGS YOU NEED
- YOUR LAPTOP
- AN INTERNET CONNECTION
- [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- PEN / PAPER / NOTE APP

### GETTING STARTED
- You’ll need that order object from the last task.

### TASK
1. OK - so, you forgot an item on that order. Why don’t you PUT something else on it.
2. Stuck? Phone a friend. (Or turn to the person next to you)
3. Are you thinking about just generating a new order with the new line item? This is a good workaround - but not the solution.
4. Still stuck eh?
5. What have you learned about Shopify orders?

#### Stuck?
Ask your volunteer the secret.
