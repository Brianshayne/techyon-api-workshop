# TASK 6: Let’s sell all the things

## SOLO TASK

### THINGS YOU NEED
- YOUR LAPTOP
- AN INTERNET CONNECTION
- POSTMAN (https://www.getpostman.com/)
- PEN / PAPER / NOTE APP

### GETTING STARTED
- You should already have the Postman collection installed.
- You should have a product object from last task.

### TASK
1. Remember that product you made? Make two more.
2. Write all three product IDs you’ve created here:

#### Stuck?
Psssst: You’re creating a product. Use the stuck hints from before to try to find the doc. Don’t forget Postman has a template for this.

#### Extra credit?
Don’t write down your product IDs, use an API call to list them. Note: Others will be working in the same store as you, so maybe note those IDs - but if you’re feeling ambitious try this anyway.
