# TASK 6: Let’s sell all the things
## SOLO TASK

### THINGS YOU NEED
- YOUR LAPTOP
- AN INTERNET CONNECTION
- POSTMAN (https://www.getpostman.com/)

GETTING STARTED
You should already have the Postman collection installed.
You should have a product object from last task.
TASK
Remember that product you made? Make two more.
Write all three product IDs you’ve created here:
















Stuck?
Psssst: You’re creating a product. Use the stuck hints from before to try to find the doc. Don’t forget Postman has a template for this.

Extra credit?
Don’t write down your product IDs, use an API call to list them. Note: Others will be working in the same store as you, so maybe note those IDs - but if you’re feeling ambitious try this anyway.
